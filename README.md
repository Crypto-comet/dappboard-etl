# DAppBoard Ethereum ETL
ETL pipeline for the Ethereum blockchain using NodeJS, EthereumJS and any Ethereum node providing RPC interface.

### How does it works?

For a given block, the block information, transactions and transaction receipts are fetched and processed by several processors which goal is to extract and structure informations such as events, ERC20 transfers, NFTs transfers and load them in a database.

### Contributors

This ETL is developped by the [DAppBoard](http://dappboard.com) team and is used there. We're glad to offer our technology to the public so anyone can understand how data are gathered and stored before being displayed.

We'd like to thanks [Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl) that inspired us and helped us organize data in a easy to understand format and where tools can be used and developed across teams and projects.
